# XAI-Credit-Scoring-System
📊 Credit Risk Prediction & Explainable AI System
🚀 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end Credit Risk Prediction System that predicts whether a borrower is likely to repay a loan or default using machine learning models.

It also integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide transparent and interpretable predictions, making the system more reliable for real-world financial applications.

🎯 Objectives
Predict loan default risk using historical borrower data
Compare multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
Provide explainability using SHAP and LIME
Build a full-stack system with FastAPI backend and React frontend
Enable real-time prediction with explanation
